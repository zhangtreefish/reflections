Howdy!
I am Treefish from Texas. The creative aspect of web design brings me to the Nanodegree program.
I have been a microbiological researcher and a college instructor. I hope to hone skills to present contents in an engaging way to students or other audiences. For example, I tried to write a song about Kawasaki Disease to engage my microbiology students and had quite some success, and so I thought what if I went further and created cartoons. I found that I could only do very limited things in places such as GoAnimate without actually learning programming. I prepared myself by taking the programming courses in Kahn Academy, and finally am here to start this fascinating journey with you guys.

To be able to click-open the files in sublime and to set up Sublime launch from git:
-Treefish ~ $ echo 'alias subl="C:/Program\ Files\ \(x86\)/Sublime\ Text\ 3/sublime_text.exe"' >> ~/.bashrc
-Treefish ~ $ subl
sh.exe": C:/Program Files (x86)/Sublime Text 3/sublime_text/exe: No such file or directory-have to close the app and relaunch for the change to take effect!
 -----
 To be able to use "git commit" with the automatic prompt for message instead of using "git commit -m <message>" :
 git config --global core.editor "'C:/Program Files (x86)/Sublime Text 3/sublime_text.exe' -n -w"

How to set up gitHub credential successfully and painlessly inside git?
-After I did this : Treefish (master #) ~ $ git push origin master
-I was prompted for usernmae which I entered: Username for 'https://github.com': zhangtreefish
-I was prompted for pwd but could not get the cursor to move: Password for 'https://zhangtreefish@github.com':
-when I hit return anyway I will get this: remote: Invalid username or password.
fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://github.com/zhangtreefish/reflections.g
it/'
-could not figure out why. One instrutor offered that "I've ran into this before, your password or username is inconsistent with your Github login." I reentered the username and password thousands of time (may be dozens of times) and of course it did not work.
-Finally I thought of setting the @users.noreply.github.com email address as the public address in gitHub (previously my personal email was set as the public email), as well as the user email at git [using config --global command]. Then the push origin master worked without getting stuck at the password. How I wish the error message were 'git user email not recognized as the public email at gitHub!' "
-----------------
My Lament
-There will be next one challenge around the corner! I hope each will not be that time-consuming...Can we learn programming more efficiently-or one just has to go through this "out-in-the woods lost" stage? In many cases I can not even understand the error message or worse, others' answers.

Susan,Thank you for getting back to me! I was able to get pwd recognized after I switched the "public email" at gitHub from my personal to the user.guthub email, but at git it is still asking me for credential, as if I did not enter the git config --global credential.helper wincred line to cach credential [although at least I can go on with git projects now.]
It is strange to me that the scheduled chat link below produced just a calendar yesterday, but is now taking me to the chat page. Do I not remember correctly or Udacity can direct the same link to diffident site for different user or even the same user on a different day? I am bewildered.  Is origin a reserved word in git? It seems to be like a pronoun for a specific repository, in existence just to be able to do push in git?
-Hi Shiyu,

That link takes you to coach chat. It doesn't change to my knowledge.

By convention, the default remote repository is called "origin", The syntax to push to it is usually:

git push origin master

Best,

Susan
