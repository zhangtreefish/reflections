Howdy!
I am Treefish from Texas. The creative aspect of web design brings me to the Nanodegree program.
I have been a microbiological researcher and a college instructor. I hope to hone skills to present contents in an engaging way to students or other audiences. For example, I tried to write a song about Kawasaki Disease to engage my microbiology students and had quite some success, and so I thought what if I went further and created cartoons. I found that I could only do very limited things in places such as GoAnimate without actually learning programming. I prepared myself by taking the programming courses in Kahn Academy, and finally am here to start this fascinating journey with you guys.

How to set up gitHub credential successfully and painlessly inside git?
-After I did this : Treefish (master #) ~ $ git push origin master
-I was prompted for usernmae which I entered: Username for 'https://github.com': zhangtreefish
-I was prompted for pwd but could not get the cursor to move: Password for 'https://zhangtreefish@github.com':
-when I hit return anyway I will get this: remote: Invalid username or password.
fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://github.com/zhangtreefish/reflections.g
it/'
-could not figure out why. One instrutor offered that "I've ran into this before, your password or username is inconsistent with your Github login." I reentered the username and password thousands of time (may be dozens of times) and of course it did not work.
-Finally I thought of setting the @users.noreply.github.com email address as the public address in gitHub (previously my personal email was set as the public email), as well as the user email at git [using config --global command]. Then the push origin master worked without getting stuck at the password. How I wish the error message were 'git user email not recognized as the public email at gitHub!' "
-There will be next one challenge around the corner! I hope each will not be that time-consuming...Can we learn programming more efficiently-or one just has to go through this "out-in-the woods lost" stage? In many cases I can not even understand the error message or worse, others' answers.
