Howdy!
I am Treefish from Texas. The creative aspect of web design brings me to the Nanodegree program.
I have been a microbiological researcher and a college instructor. I hope to hone skills to present contents in an engaging way to students or other audiences. For example, I tried to write a song about Kawasaki Disease to engage my microbiology students and had quite some success, and so I thought what if I went further and created cartoons. I found that I could only do very limited things in places such as GoAnimate without actually learning programming. I prepared myself by taking the programming courses in Kahn Academy, and finally am here to start this fascinating journey with you guys.
