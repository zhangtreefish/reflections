How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    That is obvious in logic

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    So that I learn from my own and others' experience

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: more control; Cons: human minds have their limitations.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is designed with programming in mind which often involves multiple files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Enter after $ "git log" to get the list,and then "git diff [old command] [new command]".

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Having preserved footprints allows one the backup to explore

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Write some more codes and test them! I would also like to analyse P1 further.
