When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    when one wants to share

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Automatic means machine-controlling. Humans are still better at thinking than computers.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    branch is/creates the first commit at a diverging point. Fork copies repos within gitHub; clone copies repos to local folder from either remote or local.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    So that we can have more steps for intervention, e.g., instead of doing git pull origin master, we can do git fetch origin and ten git merge master origin/master

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    By phone calls, forums, emails, and other ways of communication. The lack of documentation will be a problem without Git or GitHub. Increased (forced) interpersonal communicaiton helps to sprout new ideas.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    Making changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master allows me to keep both the legend and innovation alive. Doing it directly saves the extra step of merging branches, but can be unnerving due to the potential of messing up valuable codes.
